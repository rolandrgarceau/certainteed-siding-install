## CertainTeed Installation Guide [CTS205](https://www.certainteed.com/resources/SPG_Installation_Manual_CTS205.pdf)

The guide will be used to describe proposed procedures for your repair for both front and rear of home.

### Flashing 

Flashing around windows need to happen regardless of starter and channel per window manufacturer specs (pg 70). There exists CertainTeed CertaWrap for the wall itself. You may have thought that the optional crown molding treatment options (pg 59) was what the installers left off when doing the original install. However there may be more we need to appreciate here.

Page 45 details flashing I did not see -its up there and maybe we didn't catch it the second go at looking. Page 48 details J-channel around windows and how it holds the siding in place. The channels are designed to keep the water running down the channel and not into the house, cutting rain tabs on some sides and notches on others to force the lap and eventual water away from the sides of the window. 

Steve has a j-channel tool for reseating the locking mechanism on the front of the house- it may be referred to as a snake bar (pg 108). I believe there is also a blind cutting tool. I think the 45 cutting tool is the same. It has been over 10 years since I messed with vinyl siding, but I believe it is not a show stopper. Steve has plenty more experience in the field than I do. We also may need a cam clip and rivets to make a truly by-the-book install. That also could be why the siding failed- the clips could have been detached with the pressure washer and then the wind was able to get behind them and pull out from the wall.

### J channel installation

Wind and more importantly rain getting behind the shingles are the primary concern, that's why I wanted to be thorough with my research on the proper installation techniques. I know to make the notches we have to cut the channel 2 inches longer than the window dimensions for the bottom, making notches out for runoff. The sides get the 45 cut and rain tab, and the top folds over. I have bent flashing with a break for windows, doors, and deck bands, so I am comfortable with employing the proper procedure [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geQVbvuiNw0).

There is 2 1/2" window and door casing (larger exception) and 3 1/2" Snap-on Lineal Application around Windows and Doors as well. The Lineal Starter Application for Windows (page 50) and Door Surrounds may be closer to our solution. What I'm trying to key in on is the way to assure the bottom portions of the semi round shingles properly marry the edge at which contact happens around the window itself.

### F channel inspection (pg 83)

The soffit will meet the rake to the peak, so we need to be careful that the wind did not damage any of that and take appropriate action to assure it will not allow the soffit to be the next victim of a wind event over there. Page 118 gets into details for termination to the soffit with half round shingles.

### Temperature induced spacing

PanelThermometerTM exists on each panel that displays panel temperature and indicator lines that serve as guides for proper spacing between the panels. This will tell how large of cuts and gaps need to happen- in below 40 it is typical 3/8 expansion consideration.

## Install Cedar Impressions Metal Shingle Starter 

There may have been a metal starter that blew off somewhere? If not the install may have not been proper in the first place. See page 97. Further below we get into the half round install and there is not a mention of a metal starter that could be a little confusing. Proper cutting around a window is explained on page 99.

### Notes on steep rake for round shingles

See page 105

### Half-Round Shingles in Gable Ends

See page 115. This gives the math equation to calculate the full course height and face exposure to start dealing with a materials takeoff.
